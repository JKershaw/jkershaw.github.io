##### Hello

I've been writing software for most of my life.

I made an app a few years ago which I turned it into a company, pivoted, took though a startup accelerator, raised funding for, pitched successfully on national TV, sustained through a pandemic, and eventually sold.

Now I'm a senior developer / tech lead / consultant / early-stage CTO / amateur baker.
