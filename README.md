Hi I'm John.

I've been writing software for most of my life.

I made an app a few years ago which I turned it into a company, pivoted, took though a startup accelerator, raised funding for, pitched successfully on national TV, sustained through a pandemic, and eventually sold.

Now I'm a senior developer / teach lead / early-stage CTO / amature baker.
