##### Hello

Hi I'm John, and I've been writing software for most of my life.

I made a silly little app a few years ago which I turned it into a company, pivoted, took though a startup accelerator, raised funding for, [pitched successfully on national TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87jNnkUf4q8), sustained through a pandemic, and eventually sold.

Now I'm a senior developer / tech lead / VC consultant / early-stage CTO / amateur baker.
